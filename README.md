# Trading Engine

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a high-performance trading engine built in C#. The trading engine plays a vital role in financial markets, serving as the core system responsible for executing trades based on buy and sell orders. With the capability to handle over 1000 transactions per second, this engine is tailored for rapid and accurate trading execution. Utilizing efficient algorithms, a dynamically scalable architecture, and advanced features like a proprietary logging library and robust error handling, this trading engine aims to set new benchmarks in terms of speed, reliability, and resilience.

### What is a Trading Engine?
A trading engine is the heart of any electronic trading platform. It takes in buy and sell orders, processes them according to specific algorithms, and then matches them to execute trades. In financial markets, speed and accuracy are of utmost importance, and this engine is designed to excel in both. It has to ensure that orders are matched fairly and efficiently, thereby providing liquidity and facilitating price discovery in the marketplace.

## Significance
The significance of a high-performance trading engine cannot be overstated in today's fast-paced financial markets. As trading volumes continue to grow and market dynamics become increasingly complex, the need for a robust, scalable, and efficient trading engine becomes crucial. This project is an attempt to meet those challenges head-on and provide a solution that can serve as the backbone of a high-frequency trading (HFT) system, institutional trading desks, or even cryptocurrency exchanges.

## Features

### High Throughput
This engine can process over 1000 transactions per second, making it ideal for high-frequency trading environments where every millisecond counts.

### Efficient Algorithms
The engine employs state-of-the-art algorithms that ensure speedy order matching and execution. The algorithms are designed for maximum efficiency, ensuring that even during market spikes, the system performs reliably.

### Optimized System Architecture
The architecture is designed to minimize bottlenecks and ensure a balanced distribution of computational resources. This not only accelerates trading but also makes the system more reliable and resilient to market volatility.

### Proprietary Logging Library
The built-in logging library is custom-tailored to reduce latency and integrate seamlessly with the trading engine. This is critical for real-time diagnostics and auditing, as well as for compliance with financial regulations.

### Robust Error Handling
The engine is programmed to detect and reject 99% of invalid transactions, including those involving invalid security identifiers or 'order not found' errors. This significantly enhances the integrity and reliability of the trading platform.

### Dynamic Order Book
The order book is the cornerstone of any trading engine, maintaining a list of buy and sell orders. This engine features a dynamic order book with structured OrderbookEntry classifications, defined limit levels, and multiple permissioning interfaces. It provides an efficient and transparent mechanism for matching buyers and sellers, making the trading process more streamlined and efficient.
